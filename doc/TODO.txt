		return super().baz(arg)

- show how to make a python daemon:
	https://pypi.org/project/python-daemon/

- add some ipython demos

- add demos of the prompt_toolkit:
	https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit

- add demos of dispy distribution framework
	http://dispy.sourceforge.net

- do examples of the following packages:
	operator
	functools

- do examples of how to check python code without running it.
	There are many ways to do it.
	References:
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4284313/how-can-i-check-the-syntax-of-python-script-without-executing-it

- write a python example which does many things simulteneously using 'asynccore' or 'asyncio':
	- having console UI (like cmd) receiving events on every click.
	- receiving file system events with fnotify.
	- receiving signals from processes that it runs in the background.
	- receiving signals from ssh sessions (paramiko).
	- signals (like SIGINT).
	- printing stuff on the screen.

- add example about making a manual page out of pydoc comments.
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7176560/generating-python-cli-man-page
	This is using sphinx which is already a dependency of this package.

- pass check_all and make it part of the build.

- print the number of examples and lines of code on the README.md
	file using templar.

- add a make check_code which runs the python compiler on all the scripts
	(but does not run them, just checks the syntax).
	how do I do that?!?
- demo the 'asyncio' module.
- do example of using the multithreading module.
- do an example of how to exit from a python script
	(quit(),exit(), os._exit() and all).
- do an oo demo of 'isinstance' and 'issubclass'
- show the problems of inheritance in python and why we need __
- show using the iterator interface directly.
- do an example that demonstrates the difference between inheriting
	from 'object' and not. See the 'type' example for a starting point for this one.
- do more realistic singleton examples. With multi-thread support,
	safe from direct construction and real static methods.
- do a singleton example by overloading the __new__ operator and always
	returning the same object.
- do a multi theading example that shows thread ids at the operating system level.
- do example about finally.
- do example about division and //.
- do example about cyclic dependency between modules.
- do example of items in the dict example and more.
- show a demo of a profiler.
- show how to see garbage collector events.
- show examples about data strcutures from third parties.
- see that I have examples of the following:
	- classmethod
	- property.
	- decorators.
	- locks.
	- system(3) wrappers.
	- fork and exec.
- do demo of dis.dis for disassembly.
- show examples of controlling recursion depth via sys.setrecusionlimit.
- do examples along the lines of
	http://www.python-course.eu/pipes.php
