- .pyc, .pyo, __pycache__ files are created in the system folders
	of python to speed up the running of python.
	Try the following command line to see them:
		find /usr/lib/python3.5 -name "*.pyc" -or -name "*.pyo" -or -name "__pycache__"

- how do you know the version of the python package you have?
	On an rpm based system (fedora, centos, redhat)
	rpm -q -i python

- how to manage python
	A good rule for beginners is to use the default python.
	Do NOT roll your own unless you reach guru status!!!
	Once you do hit a certain level you can start installing your
	versions of python, use virtualenv etc.
	virtualenvwrapper is highly recommended for any Python user who works on more than one project.
