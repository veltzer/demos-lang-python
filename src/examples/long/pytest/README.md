This example shows how to do tests using pytest

The idea is:
- create a folder named "tests"
- create files called "test_*.py" files in the "tests" folder.
- in those "test_*.py" files create functions called test_*()
- if they succeed the test succeeds and if they throw an exception the test fails.
- run "pytest" from the root (where the tests folder is a subfolder).
