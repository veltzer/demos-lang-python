This is a basic example of how to use python modules.

Things to note:
- modules or scripts search for other modules relative
to where THEY ARE, not to the current working directory.
- this means that you do not need to add '.' to your python path
or whatever for a script to find module relative to WHERE THE SCRIPT IS.
- this also means that you can run the script from any folder and it
will run just the same.
