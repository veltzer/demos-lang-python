"""
Examples of constructors in python.
You must accept at least one argument in a constructor in order for it
to count as a constructor. You can also write a 'varargs' constructor.
Errors for not having the right method occur at runtime and not at
compile time. Because python does not have overloading then if you
do decide to write an __init__ method you have to write it well in
order to avoid a runtime error.

Note that in python2.7 you should have inherited from 'object'
this is no longer required in python3.

strictly speaking __init__ in python is not a constructor
but an initializer since __init__ receives 'self' which is already
an object of the required type.

If you don't write an explicit '__init__' initializer for your
class then your class still works. It's just that it's empty.
