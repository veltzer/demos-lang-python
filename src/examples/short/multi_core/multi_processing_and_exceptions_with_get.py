"""
This example shows how to handle the exceptions that happen in a multiprocessing
python process in the main process that launched that process.

The idea is that when you call 'apply_async' you get a "future" object.
When you call 'get' on that object you block until you get it's result.

In order to launch multiple concurrent processes you call 'async_apply'
multiple times and store the "future" objects in an array.
After the processing is done you iterate the array and get all the results.
See below.

results = []
for i in range(10):
    results.append(pool.apply_async(sleep_a_little, [i]))

        r = result.get()
