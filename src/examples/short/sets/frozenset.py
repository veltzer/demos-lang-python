"""
This example shows the difference between set and frozenset.

Notes:
- you cannot modify a frozen set. It does not support the 'add' and 'remove' methods.
- if you try to put a set into a set then you get an error since set is non hashable.
- the hash code of frozenset(a,b) is the same as the hash code for frozenset(b,a)
the result of which is that if you put frozenset(b,a) into a set which already contains
frozenset(a,b) then you don't actually change the set.
