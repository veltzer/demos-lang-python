"""
Example for catching all exception types.

Note that 'except Exception as e' DOES NOT catch 'KeyboardInterrupt'
exception.

You can see that by uncommenting the line which raises 'KeyboardInterrupt'...

If you want to catch all exceptions then use:
    except (Exception, KeyboardInterrupt) as exc:
"""

try:
    raise KeyboardInterrupt()
    raise ValueError('hello')
# this next line catches all exceptions, logs and throws them back...
except Exception as e:
    print('in except', e)
    raise e
finally:
    print('finally is here')
