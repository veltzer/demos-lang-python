"""
Example of how to receive signals synchronously via select and signal.set_wakeup_fd
This is copy of the referenced example which underwent heavy massaging.

Notes:
- this example works both in python 2 and 3.

TODO:
- When we get a signal in this example we still do not know what the signal is.

        We need this functions since python, unlike glibc, does not restart system

        signal handler called by the system call not restarted. This means that the
        signal handler will work, will write the single byte to the pipe, but we will
        not be woken up by poll and instead, as is in python, an IOError will fly
        out with errno=EINTR.
