# Phonebook

Definition: a phone book is a file on disk with the following format:

```text
mark,050-5665636
shay,054-4506093
```

Create an application that reads the phone book on startup and shows the following
menu to the user:

```text
1) Search for a phone according to name.
2) Delete a contact by name.
3) Add a contact (name and phone).
4) Alter a contacts phone according to name.
5) Save the phonebook and exit.
```

Then get the users choice using `input`, and acts on the users choice.

In Phase1 *do not implement all the options (1-5). Only option [1]*

Try to organize your code into functions.
