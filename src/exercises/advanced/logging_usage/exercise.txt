Use the python logging library.

Create two logging object.
The first logger object:
	- will write to a file called "log.txt"
	- will have severity "WARNING"
		(this means it will only print message of severity WARNING and above)

The second logger object:
	- will send all of his message to the system logger.
		(Eventlog in windows, syslog in linux/MacOSX).
	- will have severity "DEBUG"

Demonstrate that your loggers work as expected.
