We want to time how long it takes our functions to run.

Write a decorator called "time_it", which measures the time it takes a function to run.

Allow the user to get the statistics that you collected at the end of the run.

Here is how I would use the decorator that you wrote:

@time_it
def my_function(...):
	...


Hint:
- you will need the 'time' module to actually know what the time is.
