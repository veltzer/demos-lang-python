Your script is given a name of a test file.
You are to read the file and print out the three most common words
appearing in the file.

A separator between words is only space and new line (no need to worry
about ".", ",", "-" etc)

Start by creating a dictionary which stores all the unique words in the file
as keys and the count of each word as a value.
