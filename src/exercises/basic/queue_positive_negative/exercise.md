# Queue Positive Negative

Given a queue of numbers, return a queue with the same number where the negative
ones are at the head of the queue. Maintain the relative position of the elements.

Use only queues in your solution.

Example:

```text
1 2 3 -4 -5 -> -4 -5 1 2 3
1 -1 2 -2 3 -3 -> -1 -2 -3 1 2 3
```
