# Show All Users

This is an exercise in parsing.

Write a script that shows all user names on a UNIX system.

In a UNIX system the users are listed in the file '/etc/passwd'
which is a text file where every line has the following form:

```text
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

The first field is the user name.
