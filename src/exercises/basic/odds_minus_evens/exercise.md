# Odds Minus Evens

* Write a function that gets a list of integers and returns the sum of odd numbers in the list minus the sum of even numbers in the list.

* Here is an example:
if the list is [1,2,3,4] then the odd numbers are 1 and 3
and the even numbers are 2 and 4.
the sum of odds is 1+3=4
the sum of evens are 2+4=6
and the odds minus evens is 4-6=-2
so the function should return -2.

* Demonstrate the use of the function.
