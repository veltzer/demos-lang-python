Write a function called "substring(s1, s2)" which
receives two strings and returns True iff (if and only if)
s1 is a substring of s2.

hints:
* You can iterate the characters of string with a for loop.
For example:
my_string = "hello"
for c in my_string:
	print(c)
will print all the characters in the string "hello", one on each line.
* if you have a string and you want to access it's n'th characters then
	s[n] will give you that character

Examples:
hi, Ship -> True
shi, Ship -> False
Ships, Ship -> False
