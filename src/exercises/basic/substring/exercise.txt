Write a function called "substring(s1, s2)" which
receives two strings and returns True iff (if and only if)
s1 is a substring of s2, otherwise return False.

Examples:
hi, Ship -> True
shi, Ship -> False (notice the difference case for the letter 's')
Ships, Ship -> False (s2 is a substring of s1 but s1 is NOT a substring of s2)

hints:
* You can iterate the characters of string with a for loop.
	For example:
	my_string = "hello"
	for c in my_string:
		print(c)
	will print all the characters in the string "hello", one on each line.
* if you have a string named 's' and you want to access it's 'n'th character then
	s[n] will give you that character (n should be an integer and represent
	a valid position within the string)
* if you want to access a substring of a string from location x to location
	y (not including y) then s[x:y] will give you that slice of the string.
