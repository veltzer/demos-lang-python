Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is a notation for methmatical operations.
Lets see an example:
	2 3 +

In RPN we don't need parenthesis.
For example, say we want to express the following, which requires parenthesis:
	(3+4)*5 ( = 35 )
In RPN we just write:
	3 4 + 5 *

Write an RPN evaluator which is a piece of code that receives an RPN expression
as input and returns the value of the expression.

Assumption: all numbers are non negative integers.

You can check if a string is a positive integer in python by using the 'isdigit' method.
