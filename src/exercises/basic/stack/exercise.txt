Implement a stack in four different ways:
	1. using the built in python 'list'
	2. using a constant size list with your own integer to mark up to which point the stack has been filled.
	3. same as (2) but with no checks for correct state of the container to enhance performance.
	4. using the built in python collections.deque
Compare the performance of the four data structure.
Can you explain the results?
Show how to reverse a string using any one of your implementations.
