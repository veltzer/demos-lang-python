# Stack

Implement a stack in four different ways:
* using the built in python 'list'
* using a constant size list with your own integer to mark up to which point the stack has been filled.
* same as (2) but with no checks for correct state of the container to enhance performance.
* using the built in python collections.deque
Compare the performance of the four data structure.
