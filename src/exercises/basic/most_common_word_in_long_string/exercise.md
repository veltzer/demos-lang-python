# Most Common Word In A Long String

You are given a long string:

"To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To dieâ€”to sleep,"

Write a piece of python code to find the word most used in this soliloquy.
The string can be hardcoded in your program.
